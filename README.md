# Build a porfolio
This is a project I worked on for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree course. Based on a designed mockup, I created this fully responsive portfolio page in HTML and CSS. 

# Page Layout
**Header**: Logo, name and title
**Body**: Hero image with 3 featured projects
**Footer**: Links to email, LinkedIn and GitHub
